# Configuration Reference

Yulu reads active configuration from
`~/Library/Application Support/Yulu/config.json`. The Application Runtime creates
it with private per-user defaults. The file contains product preferences, paths,
and Agent selection only; it must not contain Agent or connector secrets.
`~/.config/yulu/config.json` is a legacy, read-only migration input.

The current schema separates the audio engine, Summary Provider, Conversation
Provider, and connectors. The explicitly selected audio engine handles realtime
captions, final transcription, and dictation; local is the default and no
capability silently falls back to another provider or model.

Unknown keys are generally preserved for forward compatibility, but retired
runtime keys are archived and removed on Host startup.

## `audio`

| Field | Installer value | Meaning |
|---|---:|---|
| `backend` | `"daemon"` | Native `Yulu.app` capture. This is the supported product path. |
| `output_dir` | `~/Movies/Yulu` | Recording content root. The Host accepts completed recordings only from this root. |
| `mic_device` | `""` | Optional native microphone selection. Empty uses the current default. |
| `silence_threshold` | `0.01` | System-audio silence threshold used by capture behavior. |
| `silence_duration_sec` | `300` | Auto-stop threshold for prolonged silence. |
| `half_duplex` | `true` | Prefer system audio while others speak and microphone during system silence. |

`mic_device`, `output_dir`, `silence_threshold`, and `silence_duration_sec` are
read when the next recording starts and do not require an audio-daemon restart.
The microphone selector is populated by the running native CoreAudio daemon;
an empty `mic_device` keeps the current macOS default input.

Native permission state is not configuration. `Yulu.app` must be allowed under
Microphone and Screen & System Audio Recording in macOS Settings.

## `agent_pipeline`

This section controls durable recording work, not an AI implementation.

| Field | Default | Meaning |
|---|---:|---|
| `enabled` | `true` | Master switch for automatic recording processing. When false, durable Agent work pauses in `awaiting_policy`; the separately selected audio engine remains available for transcription and dictation. |
| `auto_process_recordings` | `true` | Accept completed recordings and dispatch automatic tasks. When false, recordings remain saved, automatic work pauses, and explicit manual processing stays available. |
| `notion_destination` | `"Yulu Meeting"` | Legacy human-readable destination hint retained for migration. It cannot trigger sharing and is not a credential or database secret. |

Recording Processing always ends after the transcript and summary are durably
committed. The retired `auto_send_notion` compatibility setting is archived and
removed on upgrade and cannot authorize an external write. Sharing begins only
from a new explicit manual Share Action.

The switches have deliberately different scope. `enabled=false` pauses recording
processing at `awaiting_policy`; it does not disable the independently selected
audio engine. `auto_process_recordings=false` pauses only automatic intake and
automatic dispatch. Explicit transcription and dictation remain available, and
choosing a manual summary action for an automatic `awaiting_policy` task promotes
the recording into a new explicit manual summary task after retiring the paused
automatic work.

## `intelligence`

`summary` and `conversation` are independent provider/model selections. `agent`
uses an explicit Agent Connection Center selection in the form
`{ "provider": "agent", "connectionId": "…", "model": "exact-model" }`.
Codex and Claude Code therefore keep both the exact connection ID
and exact tested model; `runtime-managed` is only a legacy compatibility value,
not proof that a current connection is ready. `xai` stores the exact configured
model name and resolves to the direct xAI connection. Summary tasks and
conversation sessions snapshot the connection/provider/model identity at
creation, so later settings changes affect only new work. No credential belongs
in either object; persisted tasks and xAI conversation sessions store only
non-secret credential class/source identities such as `runtime-oauth`, `oauth`,
or `api-key`. Codex and Claude Code readiness evidence also records only a
non-secret authorization class. Codex accepts `chatgpt`; Claude Code accepts
`claude-subscription`. An observed `api-key`, `amazon-bedrock`, or unknown class
does not satisfy their Runtime-owned OAuth contract and invalidates current
readiness without deleting historical evidence.

When a pinned Summary Provider is unavailable after transcript commit, the task
enters `awaiting_provider` and stays there until an explicit same-provider retry.
Yulu never rewrites the existing snapshot from current settings.

Both automatic and manual xAI summaries use only the snapshotted instructions
and the committed transcript. Requests use the exact pinned model with response
storage disabled; the returned Markdown must pass Host staging validation before
the transcript/summary pair and artifact provenance are committed.

xAI conversations pin their scope when created. General questions send the
question and bounded conversation history without searching recordings. Meeting
questions search local meeting summaries and transcripts before a request.
Yulu sends at most 8 normalized sources, 1,200 characters per excerpt,
6,000 characters total across source titles, dates, kinds, and excerpts, and a
local-history tail of at most 12 messages and 12,000 characters. No matching
excerpt sends no request in meeting scope. Existing conversations retain meeting
scope during migration; changing scope requires a new conversation.
Requests use the pinned model and credential source
with `store:false` and no tools, files, collections, Web/X search, connectors,
or response chaining, and reject a different response model. Source cards come
from those local search hits, not model output. A retrieval or request failure
pauses the local session without changing its identity or deleting messages and
sources. Explicit retry is one Host mutation and reuses the persisted evidence
snapshot; current settings and a fresh search cannot replace it.

xAI answers use the [Responses streaming protocol](https://docs.x.ai/developers/model-capabilities/text/streaming).
Partial text appears in the existing conversation UI and voice answer panel;
only a validated completed response is stored as the final answer. A lost stream
is an Unknown Outcome and is never silently replayed. The answer panel opens
without activating Yulu, and follow-up voice questions retain their session.

## `transcription`

One explicit Yulu audio engine handles realtime captions, final transcription,
and dictation. The default is local and there is no automatic fallback.

| Field | Installer value | Meaning |
|---|---:|---|
| `engine` | `"local"` | `local` or `xai`; the selected value is used exactly for all audio transcription paths. |
| `language` | `"zh"` | `zh`, `en`, `ja`, or `auto`. Japanese requires the `xai` engine; Settings rejects the unsupported `local` + `ja` combination. |
| `captions.realtime_enabled` | `false` | Opt-in realtime meeting captions. When false, capture skips starting the realtime session; the full transcript is still produced after the recording stops. Dictation keeps using the realtime endpoints and is unaffected. |
| `captions.status_window_enabled` | `false` | Opt-in floating recording status window with live captions. When false, no `recorder_status` window is launched during recordings. |
| `local.final_model` | `"fire-red"` | Model for local final transcription. `fire-red` uses the offline FireRedASR large int8 model (~1.7 GB download from Settings); if the model is not installed, final transcription fails visibly with install guidance instead of silently degrading. `paraformer-replay` reuses the streaming Paraformer model and needs no extra download. |
| `local.offline_threads` | *(auto)* | CPU threads for the offline transcription worker. When unset, defaults to `min(4, cores-2)` with a floor of 2. The worker also runs at low priority (`os.nice(10)`, `OMP_NUM_THREADS=1`) and exits after each task. |
| `dictation.cleanup_enabled` | `true` | Clean up normal xAI dictation through the explicitly selected and authorized xAI conversation connection. Local dictation stays on-device; short text and failed cleanup keep the original transcript. |
| `dictation.voice_chat_scope` | `"general"` | Default voice-question scope: `general` uses conversation history only; `meetings` enables meeting questions. Changing this setting starts a new voice conversation on the next question. |
| `dictation.prompt_slug` | `"dictation-cleanup"` | Local prompt selected for normal dictation cleanup. |
| `dictation.translate_prompt_slug` | `"dictation-translate"` | Local prompt selected for quick translation. |
| `dictation.target_language` | `"English"` | Default target for dictation translation and the realtime-caption language selector. |
| `dictation.context_limit` | `240` | Maximum local prompt/glossary context characters. |
| `dictation.deadline_sec` | `30` | End-to-end post-capture budget used by installed shortcuts. |
| `dictation.timeout_sec` | `30` | Host/Agent request budget used by installed shortcuts. |
| `dictation.translate_deadline_sec` | `30` | Translation-specific deadline override. |
| `dictation.translate_timeout_sec` | `30` | Translation-specific request override. |

Dictation cleanup is a bounded text transform in the Host using the existing
stateless xAI client. It sends only the current utterance and its selected
prompt/glossary, with no meeting retrieval, history or tools. It requires current
xAI conversation disclosure and never switches providers. Cleanup has at most
eight seconds within the remaining dictation deadline; setting `prompt_slug` to
`"none"` also disables it. Translation and voice questions skip normal cleanup.
History retains both the recognized text and final text when cleanup runs.

Realtime xAI requests include the current glossary keyterms. Dictation,
translation and voice questions can reuse a trusted realtime transcript;
startup/finalization are bounded and cancellation clears the matching session.
Automatic insertion reports success only after Accessibility read-back confirms
the text. If insertion cannot be verified, the text is kept on the clipboard for
manual paste.

The Host accepts on-demand audio only from the configured recordings directory
or `~/Library/Application Support/Yulu/dictation`, and only as a valid absolute
WAV path.

Settings → AI Providers is the authoritative Agent Connection Center.
xAI is connected there using Grok CLI-compatible OAuth or an API key the user
explicitly chooses. OAuth tokens and API keys stay
in separate macOS Keychain items; neither is a configuration field or browser
read-back value. OAuth remains primary while present, and an OAuth or entitlement
failure never causes an automatic switch to the saved API key. The page records
separate real-request readiness for transcription, summary, and conversation.
Opening or deep-linking it performs status inspection only; it does not
implicitly run a capability probe or model request.
Discovery remains non-mutating: it creates Connection Candidates but never
selects an Agent or capability. If a supported runtime is missing, install it
or make it visible on the Yulu Host PATH. Agent Connection Center can open that
runtime's fixed native login command in Terminal; after login, return and
refresh its non-secret native status before explicitly connecting and selecting
a capability. Starting reauthorization invalidates current readiness without
deleting history. Yulu does not read, parse, or copy the runtime's OAuth token
files. Claude Summary remains unavailable unless one isolated invocation proves
both the exact provider and model; missing provider evidence is not readiness.
Upgrades archive and remove the retired `transcription.xai_credential_source`
field; Hermes/OpenClaw credentials are not imported or deleted.

Hermes and OpenClaw are Conversation-only entries in Agent Connection Center;
they are never selectable as Summary providers. OpenClaw readiness uses the
runtime-owned Gateway and the stable, raw `infer model run --gateway` surface so
the probe has no agent tools, prior session, bootstrap context, or bundled MCP.
The subsequent Conversation stays pinned to the exact provider, model, and
native session returned by `openclaw agent`. Hermes 0.20.0 has no documented
empty tool allowlist or equivalent raw probe, so its production adapter remains
fail-closed even when native OAuth status is healthy.

## `llm` and Agent Console

`llm` configures legacy general-Agent behavior. It does not select transcription,
summaries, or conversation identity: those use `transcription.engine` and the two
`intelligence` selections. Future Agent Console sessions require an explicit
ready `intelligence.conversation` connection; an existing session keeps its
pinned connection, provider, model, and native session identity.

| Field | Default | Meaning |
|---|---:|---|
| `enabled` | `false` | Keep the retired general-Agent path disabled. Current conversations use the explicit `intelligence.conversation` selection. |
| `command` | `null` | Optional explicit general-Agent argv. No shell interpolation is performed. |
| `agent.provider` | `"auto"` | Legacy general-Agent hint. Supported current connections are selected explicitly in AI Providers; Hermes and OpenClaw remain optional Conversation-only providers. |

When `provider=auto`, the general runtime detects supported CLIs in its current
priority order. This does not change any existing audio/task/session snapshot.
If the pinned Summary Provider is unavailable, a recording transcript remains
committed while its summary task waits in `awaiting_provider`.

To pause automatic recording processing, set `agent_pipeline.enabled=false`.
Realtime captions, transcription, and dictation remain controlled by the selected
audio engine. `llm.enabled` controls only the legacy general-Agent path.

`agent_console.plugins.added` is a presentation filter for capabilities shown in
Agent Console. `agent_console.destinations` stores human-readable destination
hints. Credentials, OAuth state, connector tools, and actual connection settings
belong to the Agent. The legacy `agent_pipeline.notion_destination` value cannot
independently trigger sharing. A manual Share Action pins its destination separately.

## Sharing configuration

Settings → Sharing is the authoritative destination and Test Share surface. It
selects a Supported Agent Connection independently from `intelligence.summary`
and `intelligence.conversation`, discovers connector targets with a read-only
operation, and reports Connector Readiness only after a separate bounded probe.
A suggested target remains unconfigured until the user explicitly saves it and
the Host reads back the exact destination. Notion discovery stores the exact
structured `notion_create_pages` parent (`{"page_id":"..."}` or
`{"data_source_id":"..."}`), not a matching page title or nested hint.
Structured parent objects and their JSON-string representation normalize to the
same saved identity; malformed or ambiguous parents are not suggested. A Notion
page link or page ID can also be pasted directly; saving converts it to an
explicit page parent and reads that value back. Page titles, malformed IDs and
untrusted URLs are rejected before sending. Saving alone never creates a page.
A shared Notion page can include only the fixed required title `Yulu Share`, never an inferred
meeting title or additional properties. The approved content remains unchanged.

Sharing and Agent Calendar connector calls use the selected Connection's explicit
Conversation model. They pass that exact model to the CLI instead of inheriting
the CLI's mutable global default. An unselected model stops before execution;
there is no implicit model fallback.
Codex connector operations use low reasoning for bounded configuration and
receipt work, without changing the user's global CLI or Conversation settings.
Notion Apps bridge names are recognized only within the exact Notion namespace;
discovery is limited to one recent-page list (limit 10) or a basic Yulu search,
not shared/private/favorite-page enumeration. Tool lifecycle updates sharing the
same call ID count as one operation; distinct writes never collapse together.

On macOS, runtime scanning also offers Codex CLIs already bundled in the Codex
or ChatGPT desktop App. An alternate path remains a candidate even when a PATH
CLI is connected. Choosing it is explicit, performs the normal runtime/OAuth
status validation and uses the exact model entered; scanning alone never
switches the active runtime or installs/upgrades any global program.

Sharing Readiness additionally requires a freshly confirmed Test Share that
contains only Yulu's connection-verification message. The selected Agent must
then read the external object back through the connector and prove that its
destination, exact content, and receipt match. Connector credentials remain
owned by the selected Agent runtime; Yulu persists only the non-secret
connection, connector, destination, receipt identity, and per-attempt status in
the Host database. Codex runs these operations from a short-lived project that
contains only Yulu's guard, empty config marker, and non-secret audit file while
inheriting the unchanged user `CODEX_HOME`, auth, and connector configuration.
Yulu passes the guard as a per-invocation `PreToolUse` hook overlay because that
is the Codex 0.144.4 path proven to load without mutating persistent trust or
configuration. The hook runs for every tool call: foreign tools are denied before
execution, read phases permit only their explicit read allowlist, and the write
phase permits one selected-connector tool only when its structured destination
and single approved payload match exactly (plus the fixed Notion title). That authorization is
consumed atomically before execution, so a second write in the same Test Share
is denied before it can reach the connector. Before starting any connector
turn, Yulu also requires `codex features list` to report exactly
`hooks stable true`; experimental, disabled, or unavailable hooks fail closed.
Yulu never copies MCP `env`,
`env_vars`, `http_headers`, or `env_http_headers` into the project. A missing,
unsupported, or bypassed hook fails the operation closed.

Codex 0.144.4 can still initialize other servers inherited from its runtime
configuration; it does not expose a credential-safe selected-server-only switch.
Yulu intentionally does not inspect or reconstruct the credential-bearing MCP
inventory. Those foreign servers remain unusable by this operation because the
pre-tool guard denies every non-selected tool call before execution.

Codex connector calls have a bounded 60-second initialization allowance in
addition to their operation deadline: runtime-owned plugin, skill and MCP setup
can otherwise consume the whole readiness probe before `SessionStart`. A timeout
remains a failure, and an uncertain write remains fenced rather than retried.
Yulu preserves structured `turn.failed` errors ahead of secondary hook/audit
diagnostics, distinguishing a CLI/model incompatibility, a timeout, unavailable
hooks and an unproven guard. It does not change the selected model or credentials
to recover. Hook availability alone does not prove the CLI supports that model.

Discovery, access, write, and read-back results are accepted only when the Agent
session contains a successful selected-connector tool call. Write/read-back
evidence must prove the destination, full content, and receipt identity rather
than matching substrings. Transport failures and partial outcomes are rejected.
Standard MCP text envelopes are decoded only when they contain one structured
JSON result. Notion's current fetch envelope is parsed for the actual page URL,
direct parent in its ancestor path, and full enhanced-Markdown content. Only UUID
hyphen/case, trusted page-link presentation, and Notion's discarded empty
paragraph separators normalize; code whitespace, content order, additions and
omissions do not. Conflicting IDs, truncated or unknown blocks, malformed page
wrappers and parent-title hints cannot verify a receipt. Notion's native page
verification state and words such as "error" in the document are not transport
statuses. The Host validates the tool facts and preserves the original receipt;
model-authored JSON cannot substitute for or override that proof. An interrupted or
unverifiable write is fenced as an Unknown Outcome across Host restarts; a hook
feature rejection or guard denial proven to occur before authorization is an
ordinary failed attempt, not an Unknown Outcome. An unknown attempt
cannot be retried until the user reconciles a verified receipt or abandons that
attempt. Each confirmation creates one durable client action ID, making request
replay idempotent, and a prior verified Test Share requires a duplicate-write
confirmation before another is sent. Sharing Readiness also requires a current
Connector Readiness proof for the selected connection revision.

The Unknown Outcome fence is intentionally snapshot-scoped, not global: it
prevents a duplicate external effect for the same Agent Connection, Connector,
explicit destination, and fixed Test Share content. Selecting and saving a
different snapshot creates a different external-effect target; returning to the
old snapshot restores its unresolved fence.

## `status_agent`

The menu-bar Agent exposes recording state and global shortcuts. Hotkey modifiers
are `cmd`, `shift`, `alt`, and `ctrl`. The default shortcuts are:

- `ctrl+alt+Space`: dictation;
- `ctrl+alt+T`: translation;
- `ctrl+alt+A`: voice question into Agent Console.

Use `yulu status-agent hotkeys` to inspect the effective values.

`voice_input_mode` defaults to `"toggle"`: press once to start and again to
finish. The optional `"hold"` mode starts on key down and finishes on key release
for all three shortcuts. A release before capture starts queues one stop after
confirmation; repeated key events cannot start another recording. Canceling
clears the pending gesture, and callbacks from an older command cannot restore
its overlay. Both modes are available in Voice Input settings.

The native voice panel follows the system light/dark appearance. While recording,
it shows the input level, finish and cancel controls. An unverified or failed
insertion keeps the recognized text visible with a Copy Text button until
dismissed or another recording starts. The complete text remains in local
dictation history even if the destination application or clipboard fails.
Only verified insertion displays the brief Inserted confirmation.

## Calendars and meeting detection

Calendar/window detection exists only to decide when to offer native capture. It
is not the connector surface used by Agent Console.

The recommended calendar source is `type: "macos"`, which reuses calendars
already visible in macOS Calendar. `watch_calendars` may be empty for all visible
calendars or contain explicit names. `meeting_detection` controls window polling,
stability, and cooldown for recording prompts.

Interactive calendar reasoning and other connector actions belong to the selected
general Agent.

## Themes

`ui.theme.family` is `default`, `ayu`, `paper`, or `custom`.
`ui.theme.mode` is `auto`, `light`, or `dark`. Custom light/dark token maps are
optional and may override wallpaper, surfaces, edges, text, muted text, accent,
and semantic colors.

## Automatic migration of retired settings

When the Host opens the config, it performs one-way, auditable retirement:

- old inference settings are copied to
  `config.legacy-transcription.<timestamp>.json` and removed from the active
  `transcription` object; the retired `realtime_captions` block and Hermes audio
  service fields are archived in the same file and removed as well;
- old Yulu-owned external-delivery settings are copied to
  `config.legacy-connectors.<timestamp>.json`; destination hints and explicit
  Notion opt-in are projected into the Agent-native fields before the active
  blocks are removed;
- archives are written with mode `0600` and are not active runtime inputs.

The settings API rejects attempts to write a retired inference field. Do not copy
archived keys back into `config.json`.

## Validation and safety

Validate syntax without exposing the file contents:

```bash
python3 -m json.tool "$HOME/Library/Application Support/Yulu/config.json" >/dev/null
yulu doctor --json
```

Operational guidance:

- Keep `config.json`, `mcp-token.json`, `host.sqlite`, and task workspaces out of
  Git and cloud-sync folders.
- Store Agent and connector credentials in the Agent's own credential store.
- Prefer the Settings UI or Yulu commands for updates; the Host performs atomic
  writes and rejects stale concurrent edits.
- After changing Agent availability or pipeline settings, restart the Host with
  `yulu restart` and verify `yulu doctor --json`.
