## Project

**Yulu (语录)** is an Agent-native macOS meeting recorder. It captures system
audio and microphone input through one native TCC identity, persists each
completed recording as durable local work, and keeps audio transcription
separate from the selected summary and conversation Agents.

### Responsibility boundary

- `Yulu.app` owns native capture and macOS privacy permissions.
- The local Yulu Host owns path validation, durable tasks, idempotency, leases,
  recovery, artifact commits, authorization, and audit.
- The explicitly selected Yulu audio engine owns realtime captions, final
  transcripts, and dictation. `local` is the default; `xai` connects directly
  to xAI using Yulu-owned OAuth stored in macOS Keychain.
- The exact Summary Provider pinned when work is created owns summary generation.
  Current Summary Providers are direct xAI, Codex, or Claude Code. Hermes and
  OpenClaw are optional Conversation-only providers.
- The pinned Conversation Provider owns interactive conversation. Each session
  pins its scope: general questions use bounded conversation history; meeting
  questions can also use local meeting excerpts. xAI uses Yulu's strict
  stateless client; Agent-backed meeting conversations retain their runtime-owned
  connectors. Changing scope starts a new conversation.
- Python is capture/scheduling/desktop glue. It is not an AI runtime.

Do not add automatic fallback between audio engines or Summary Providers, a
second chat engine, connector executor, or file-only work queue to Yulu. The
accepted decisions are [`ADR-005`](yulu/spec/adr/005-agent-native-durable-recording-pipeline.md),
[`ADR-007`](yulu/spec/adr/007-explicit-audio-transcription-engines.md),
[`ADR-009`](yulu/spec/adr/009-grok-cli-compatible-xai-oauth.md), and
[`ADR-010`](yulu/spec/adr/010-offline-final-transcription-and-captions-off.md).

### Constraints

- **Platform:** macOS 13+ is the shipped capture platform.
- **Privacy:** raw capture is local; `local` transcription stays on-device and
  the explicitly selected `xai` engine uploads audio directly to xAI. Summary
  processing follows the exact pinned xAI, Codex, or Claude Code connection.
- **Durability:** task completion requires Host state and committed artifacts,
  not Agent prose or the presence of one sidecar file.
- **Side effects:** sharing is a separate, fresh, manually confirmed Share
  Action; recording completion and retired config cannot authorize it. An
  uncertain result is never blindly replayed.
- **Compatibility:** upgrade code archives retired settings, imports resolvable
  historical work, and unloads retired services.

## Technology Stack

### Languages and runtimes

- Swift 5: `audio_daemon.swift`, window/status/menu-bar helpers.
- TypeScript 5.6: loopback Host, durable coordinator, MCP, tRPC, and React UI.
- Python 3.8+: capture edge, meeting/calendar scheduling, dictation transport,
  installer, diagnostics, and CLI helpers.
- Bash: setup, lifecycle, packaging, and the `yulu` command dispatcher.
- Node.js 20.19+, 22.12+, or 24: Host and web UI; use the checked-in npm lockfile.

### Main dependencies

- macOS ScreenCaptureKit and AVFoundation for native capture.
- Hono, tRPC, Zod, WebSocket, and `better-sqlite3` for the Host.
- React, React Router, TanStack Query, Vite, and wavesurfer.js for the UI.
- Optional local Agent CLIs for the capabilities the user explicitly selects;
  Hermes and OpenClaw are Conversation-only.
- `sherpa-onnx` Paraformer for the Yulu-managed local audio engine, plus the
  offline FireRedASR INT8 + silero-vad final-transcription worker
  (`sherpa_offline_worker.py`) for the local final tier (ADR-010).
- `ffmpeg`/`sox` for audio inspection and transport preparation, including xAI
  batch-upload compression.
- Optional `gog`/`cloudflared` only for Yulu-owned calendar scheduling.

Yulu installs and manages only its local speech runtime. Connector credentials
and OAuth state belong to the Agent, not this repository or `config.json`;
Yulu's separate xAI audio OAuth grant is stored in macOS Keychain.

### Configuration and state

- Active config: `~/Library/Application Support/Yulu/config.json`.
- Current schema reference: `yulu/scripts/config.example.json` and
  `docs/configuration.md`.
- Durable task source of truth: `~/Library/Application Support/Yulu/host.sqlite`.
- Recording content: `~/Movies/Yulu/` by default.
- Private task staging: `~/Library/Application Support/Yulu/agent-tasks/`.
- Completion-event recovery inbox: `~/Library/Application Support/Yulu/recording-events/`.
- Local bearer token: `~/Library/Application Support/Yulu/mcp-token.json`; never print it.
- Runtime sockets: `~/Library/Caches/Yulu/`; logs: `~/Library/Logs/Yulu/`.
- `~/.config/yulu/` is a legacy read-only migration source.

Relevant config sections are `audio`, `transcription` (engine, language, and
dictation context), `agent_pipeline`, `llm`,
`agent_console`, `status_agent`,
`calendars`, `meeting_detection`, and `ui`.

### Build and verification

Choose checks for the changed behavior and risk. The commands below are
references, not a mandatory sequence for every change. Documentation-only changes
normally need diff, reference, and consistency checks, not a product rebuild.

```bash
python3 -m pytest -q
cd yulu/scripts/yulu_ui
npm test
npm run typecheck
npm run build
```

When the task includes installed-runtime verification, inspect the actual runtime
separately from the checkout. Run these read-only checks from the repository root:

```bash
python3 yulu/scripts/doctor.py --json
curl -fsS http://127.0.0.1:7777/healthz
```

Use `make dev-install` only for an intended, authorized development-runtime
installation. It is not a prerequisite for documentation or source-only work and
must not replace whole-App installation when accepting a signed public DMG.
Health checks establish reachability, not a successful recording or migration.
Do not infer live behavior from checkout tests alone.

## Conventions

### Change discipline

- Preserve the Agent-native ownership boundary above.
- Keep one recording pipeline and one artifact commit boundary.
- Make task state transitions explicit and test them at their durable seam.
- Treat automatic completion as idempotent; manual reprocessing is an explicit
  new attempt.
- Never edit user config, Host SQLite, recordings, tokens, or credentials in
  repository tests.

### Host and TypeScript

- `hostStore.ts` owns durable task, event, lease, artifact, and delivery state.
- `recordingPipeline.ts` owns admission, claims, selected-engine transcription,
  state transitions, summary dispatch, and recovery.
- `artifactStore.ts` commits the transcript independently, then validates and
  replaces the final summary sidecar.
- `agentGateway.ts` is the supported Agent invocation and required-tool audit
  boundary; its Hermes delivery endpoints remain legacy audit compatibility.
- Only the current lease may report progress, commit, authorize delivery, report
  delivery, or complete a task.
- Keep MCP and tRPC schemas validated with Zod. Do not expose lease tokens in
  public task reads or persisted event details.

### Python and Swift

- Python controls capture, submits/spools completion events, and handles local
  desktop workflow. New inference or connector behavior does not belong there.
- Completion spools and other state files use private permissions, temp files,
  flush/fsync where required, and atomic rename.
- Swift `Yulu.app` remains the only microphone/system-audio TCC identity.
- Do not replace the native capture arm with a cross-platform Python recorder.

### Configuration

- Credentials are never stored in `config.json`.
- Retired `agent_pipeline.auto_send_notion` is migration input only and can
  never authorize a new Share Action.
- `llm.agent.provider` selects the general Agent only. Audio uses
  `transcription.engine`; summary and conversation use their separate
  `intelligence` selections, snapshotted when work is created.
- Retired inference and Yulu-owned connector fields are archived with mode
  `0600` and removed from active config. Never reintroduce them.
- Use atomic config writes and preserve unknown forward-compatible keys unless
  they belong to a retired runtime.

### Errors and observability

- Separate native capture, Host reachability, selected provider readiness,
  artifact commit, and manual Share Action outcome in diagnostics.
- A Host restart during a possible external write yields
  `delivery_unverified`, not an automatic retry.
- `/healthz` proves only that the loopback Host is listening.
- Doctor checks are read-only and should return structured error data instead of
  throwing through the report.

## Architecture

### Recording flow

```text
calendar / window / menu / CLI / MCP
                 |
                 v
Yulu.app native capture -> local WAV
                 |
                 v

                 | Host unavailable
                 +-> atomic event spool ---+
                                           |
                                           v

                                           v
                              pinned Summary Provider workflow
                                           |
                                           +-> Host commits summary

Recording detail -> fresh confirmed Share Action -> selected Agent connector

Agent Console -> pinned Conversation Provider -> xAI bounded history/excerpts
                                           or -> selected Agent + its connectors
```

### Runtime components

| Component | Responsibility |
|---|---|
| `Yulu.app` / `audio_daemon.swift` | ScreenCaptureKit + AVFoundation capture; start/stop/status over `audio_daemon.sock` |
| `record_audio.py` / `meeting_daemon.py` | Capture control and authenticated completion delivery/spooling |
| `yulu_ui/src/server.ts` | Loopback Host, tRPC, WebSocket, UI, and authenticated MCP |
| `hostStore.ts` | Durable task, event, lease, artifact, and delivery records |
| `audioTranscription.ts` | Explicit local/xAI realtime, final, and dictation selection without fallback |
| `xaiAudio.ts` / `xaiCredentials.ts` / `xai_keychain.swift` | Direct xAI STT plus Yulu-owned device OAuth and Keychain storage |
| `recordingPipeline.ts` | Validation, idempotency, claims, transcript commit, summary dispatch, recovery |
| `agentGateway.ts` | Supported Agent invocation, connector boundary, and required-tool audit; legacy Hermes delivery audit compatibility |
| `artifactStore.ts` | Task staging and independent transcript/summary commits |
| `recordingEventInbox.ts` | Replay completion events after Host downtime |
| `agentRuntime.ts` | Supported local Agent runtime resolution for explicitly selected capabilities |
| prompt/glossary/search stores | Local context and discovery; bounded xAI conversation retrieval |
| `agentSessionStore.ts` / `xaiText.ts` | Pinned local conversation history/sources and strict stateless xAI text requests |

### Installed services

| launchd label | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `com.yulu.app.capture` | Bundled native audio capture |
| `com.yulu.app.host` | Bundled local Host and web UI |

The installed App owns menu-bar controls and auxiliary lifecycle components.
Repository-install labels (`com.yulu.ui`, `com.yulu.audiodaemon`, statusagent,
detector, scheduler, calendar, sttdaemon and agentqueue) are legacy migration
inputs, not the installed App's owners. Keep the Capture signing/TCC identifier
`com.yulu.audiodaemon` unchanged; signing identity is not a launchd label.

### Durable and security invariants

1. Completed recordings are real absolute WAV paths within the configured
   recording root and follow the recording stem contract.
2. Only the current attempt lease can mutate a task.
3. The selected Yulu audio engine produces the transcript, which the Host commits
   before pinned Summary Provider work. Summary Providers never perform production
   transcription and never fall back to another provider or model.
4. The Summary Provider commits through the Host artifact boundary; recording
   processing ends after transcript and summary commit.
5. External sharing begins only from a new, manually confirmed Share Action.
   Retired Notion fields and compatibility endpoints cannot start one; an
   uncertain outcome must be reconciled before another attempt.
6. The Host binds to loopback, validates Host headers and recording roots, and
   requires a constant-time-checked bearer token for mutating/Agent/MCP paths.
7. Runtime databases, task workspaces, sockets, tokens, and event spools remain
   machine-local.

### Task states

```text
queued -> running -> transcript_committed -> artifacts_committed -> completed
   |          |                |                       |
   |          |                +-> awaiting_provider
   |          +-> failed
   +-> awaiting_agent

legacy pre-upgrade delivery only:
sending -> delivery_reported -> completed
   +-----> delivery_unverified -> explicit confirm or abandon
```

### ADR status

- ADR-005 remains the durable task and Agent workflow decision.
- ADR-007 supersedes the audio ownership and fallback decisions in ADR-005 and ADR-006.
- ADR-009 supersedes ADR-008's summary capability boundary while retaining its
  Yulu-managed xAI credential custody and no-silent-fallback rules.
- ADR-010 restores ADR-006's two-stage quality split inside the local engine
  (streaming fast tier vs offline FireRedASR final tier) and defaults captions
  and the status window to off, without changing ADR-007 engine selection.
- ADR-002 remains relevant for glossary data; the selected audio engine consumes that context.
- Historical ADR bodies remain history and must not be treated as active
  implementation instructions.

### Anti-patterns

- Adding another audio engine or automatic engine fallback outside ADR-007.
- Using a JSON/file queue as active task ownership.
- Running summary or connector code from Python capture paths.
- Letting any current setting or runtime silently replace a task's pinned
  Summary Provider or model.
- Letting a conversation retry switch provider, model, credential source, or
  question scope or persisted local evidence snapshot.
- Writing final transcript/summary files outside the Host commit contract.
- Calling Notion without task opt-in, Host begin authorization, and Host result
  commit.
- Retrying `delivery_unverified` work before reconciling the destination.

## Project Skills

The user-facing Yulu Agent contract is [`skills/yulu/SKILL.md`](skills/yulu/SKILL.md).
The internal architecture/developer guide is [`yulu/SKILL.md`](yulu/SKILL.md).

## Agent skills

### Issue tracker

Issues and specs are tracked in GitHub Issues. See `docs/agents/issue-tracker.md`.

### Triage labels

Use the five default triage labels. See `docs/agents/triage-labels.md`.

### Domain docs

Use a single-context domain model. See `docs/agents/domain.md`.

## Engineering Workflow

- Small fixes and bounded investigations can proceed directly within the user's
  authorized scope. No specific skill framework is a prerequisite.
- Discuss complex changes before implementation. For longer work, record the
  necessary decisions, remaining tasks, and acceptance criteria; choose planning,
  task splitting, context handoffs, and independent review to fit the task.
- Use relevant `CONTEXT.md` terminology, ADRs, and existing GitHub specs/tickets
  as project evidence. See [`docs/agents/issue-tracker.md`](docs/agents/issue-tracker.md).
- Determine remaining work from the current request, observed code/runtime, and
  still-valid requirements. An unchecked historical plan item is not evidence of
  missing implementation; retain completed work and its verification evidence.
- `.planning/` and `docs/superpowers/` are historical/reference material, not the
  active execution queue or sources for regenerating repository instructions.
  Historical workflow preferences do not override current user instructions.
  Use GSD, gstack, Ask Matt, Superpowers, or another process framework only when
  the user explicitly selects it.
- Complete the requested change and affected checks without adding workflow
  gates. Preserve the project's architecture, privacy, and artifact contracts.
- Reuse applicable passing checks unless changed code, environment, or new
  evidence creates a reason to repeat them. State the source/artifact and scope
  each result covers; do not promote old evidence to an untested candidate.
- Prefer the existing physical Mac for installed-runtime investigation. Use an
  existing isolated environment only when a clean-install, supported-upgrade, or
  OS-specific requirement actually needs it; do not create a VM per candidate.
- Keep publishing, merging, deployment, installed-runtime changes, and external
  writes within their explicitly authorized scope. Local verification alone does
  not establish that a change shipped or passed installed-runtime acceptance.
