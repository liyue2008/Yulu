Yulu (语录, *yǔ lù*) is a macOS meeting workspace built around local files and
the Agents you already use. It records system audio and microphone input without
a virtual audio device, shows movable realtime captions, turns meetings into
searchable transcripts and summaries, and lets Agents work across that history.

There is no Yulu account. Recordings and task state stay on your Mac. Yulu uses
the audio engine you explicitly select for realtime captions, final transcription,
and dictation: local by default, or xAI cloud through one Grok CLI-compatible OAuth
sign-in or explicitly chosen API-key connection managed by Yulu. Yulu never silently
switches between them or between credential sources.

Transcription, Summary Provider, and Conversation Provider selections are
independent. Durable summary work and locally stored conversations retain their
creation-time provider/model identity; changing Settings affects only new work.
If the pinned Summary Provider is unavailable, the committed transcript and task
pause locally until an explicit same-provider retry instead of falling back.
For xAI summaries, Yulu sends only the task's selected instructions and committed
transcript, disables response storage, and saves validated Markdown through the
same durable artifact transaction used by Agent-backed summaries.

Core Activation names the exact selected Summary Provider and model. xAI is
ready only after its current model and credential source pass a real capability
probe and the current versioned Data Path Disclosure is accepted; OAuth or API
key presence is not acceptance to send transcript text. Activation lists only
connections that currently satisfy the shared Summary contract: direct xAI,
Codex, or Claude Code. Hermes and OpenClaw are Conversation-only
and never appear as Summary choices.

When activation readiness is green, `/activate` starts the same production
recorder used elsewhere in Yulu and suggests a natural 10–20 second recording.
Its durable Host task keeps processing after navigation or restart. Verified
audio, transcript, summary, integrity, and provider provenance establish the
milestone; guided completion opens the saved note, while other qualifying
recordings show a nonblocking link without changing the current page.

On a fresh install, Yulu opens **Onboarding Home** once to organize Core
Activation and optional capabilities. Returning users enter it only from the
normal, nonblocking navigation. Adopted or deferred optional outcomes and prior
Onboarding Completion stay durable across restarts and onboarding versions;
current readiness is shown separately and can need attention without revoking
that history. Onboarding links to existing authoritative Settings surfaces and
never copies provider, connector, OAuth, or token configuration. Sharing is
adopted only when you explicitly adopt the current verified, meeting-free Test
Share from **Settings → Sharing**; deferring it never changes current readiness.

## What you can do

| Experience | What Yulu provides |
|---|---|
| Record a meeting | Native ScreenCaptureKit system audio plus AVFoundation microphone capture, started from the UI, menu bar, calendar/window detection, CLI, or MCP |
| Follow live captions | Movie-style captions on the active display, draggable from the bottom center, with source-only, bilingual, or translation-only display; an optional private sherpa-onnx Paraformer INT8 model provides low-latency source text |
| Review every meeting | Audio playback, transcript, summary, tags, speaker corrections, templates, glossary terms, and local search in one recording library |
| Run each action explicitly | Re-transcribe, regenerate the summary, and share the summary are independent actions that can be repeated separately |
| Ask across meeting history | Agent Console pins the selected Conversation Provider: xAI receives only bounded local excerpts/history, while Agent-backed conversations retain that Agent's own retrieval and connectors |
| Speak instead of type | Global shortcuts provide dictation, quick translation, and voice questions that continue in Agent Console |
| Inspect the system | Settings and Health expose permissions, capabilities, durable tasks, daemons, scheduler state, and logs |

## Current interface

<p align="center">
  <img src="assets/demos/agent-console-desktop.png" alt="Yulu Agent Console with the current blue quotation-mark logo and recording controls" />
</p>

Agent Console is the default workspace. Start or stop recording, see recent
meeting work, ask questions across local history, and inspect the selected
provider without leaving the page. xAI conversations search locally first,
send nothing when no excerpt matches, and keep source cards and history local.
The session also pins the xAI credential source and verifies the response model.
Failures preserve the provider/model/credential identity, evidence snapshot, and
history until one explicit same-snapshot retry or a new conversation.

Open **Settings → AI Providers** for the authoritative Agent Connection
Center. It connects, discloses, tests, selects, repairs, and deletes each
capability without sending a model request merely because the page opened.
Discovery only lists candidates. Install or place the runtime on the Yulu Host
PATH, open its native login in Terminal, then return and refresh before making
an explicit connection and capability selection. Yulu never reads or copies a
runtime's OAuth tokens.
Activation and Agent Console deep-link to that exact connection and capability.
New conversations require an explicit ready selection; existing pinned sessions
keep their creation-time provider, model, connection, and native session.

Open **Settings → Sharing** to configure external delivery without changing the
Summary or Conversation Provider. Select a supported Agent Connection, run
read-only destination discovery and a separate bounded connector probe, then
explicitly save the destination. Sharing becomes ready only after you confirm a
meeting-free Test Share and the selected Agent reads back its external receipt.
Interrupted writes remain an **Unknown outcome** until you reconcile a verified
receipt or abandon that attempt; Yulu does not retry them automatically. Yulu
requires successful selected-connector tool-call evidence for discovery, access,
the write, and receipt read-back, and one client action ID cannot create two writes.
Codex Notion sharing uses bounded direct connector RPC through the selected
runtime. Yulu checks the exact tool, destination and immutable content before
dispatch; the runtime retains its own connector credentials. Other supported
connectors retain their scoped pre-tool authorization guards. An uncertain
recording Share can be checked from its Share dialog using the original receipt;
this read-only reconciliation does not create another page or regenerate a summary.

<p align="center">
  <img src="assets/demos/recordings-reader.png" alt="Yulu recording library with audio playback and transcript reader" />
</p>

The recording reader keeps the original audio, transcript, summary, and manual
actions together. Demo titles and transcript text in these screenshots are
synthetic.

## Realtime captions and translation

When recording starts, Yulu places pure movie-style subtitles near the bottom
center of the currently active display.

- Source text is the default. Install the optional local model from Settings → Transcription for private captions and transcription, or explicitly select xAI for cloud speech-to-text. The selected engine handles the whole audio path without automatic switching.
- Choose a target language and switch between source-only, bilingual, and
  translation-only views while the meeting is live.
- Drag the six-dot handle to move the caption overlay anywhere on the display.
- The recording toolbar stays visible while you interact with it, then reduces
  to a centered red dot and “Recording” state after three seconds of inactivity.
- Hover the recording state to reveal “Click to stop”.
- Collapse the captions into the breathing Yulu quotation-mark logo; click the
  logo to restore them.
- When recording stops, the overlay disappears completely.

## Quick start

### Requirements

- macOS 13 or later.
- Apple Silicon (arm64) for official release installs.
- A ready Summary Provider connection in Settings (xAI, Codex, or Claude Code)
  when you want automatic summaries. Sharing currently requires a supported
  Codex or Claude Code connection with a proven pre-tool authorization boundary;
  Hermes and OpenClaw remain Conversation-only.
- The local transcription model (default), or xAI authorized directly in
  Settings with Grok CLI-compatible OAuth plus the current Cloud Transcription
  Consent when you explicitly select xAI.
- Optionally, Codex CLI, Claude Code, OpenClaw, Hermes, or a custom command for
  Agent Console conversation.

The official App contains its compatible Application Runtime and audio tools.
Grok OAuth opens in your default browser. Complete the account login there, then
return to Yulu to test each selected capability; login alone does not prove readiness.

### Install

Download the [latest stable Yulu](https://github.com/Nowhitestar/Yulu/releases/latest).
The v0.25.0 update improves voice input and general voice questions, preserves
recognized text when automatic insertion fails, and adds a compact blue waveform
panel plus native notifications and meeting prompts. See the
[release notes and verification scope](docs/release-notes/v0.25.0.md).

For an older candidate's database or silent-capture failure, see
[database preparation](docs/operations.md#fresh-install-database-preparation) and
[silent capture](docs/operations.md#wav-exists-but-capture-is-silent). Preserve
your data: do not create empty databases, edit migration journals or clear
permissions as a workaround. A successful provider connection test does not
prove that a recording contains sound or has committed transcript and summary.

Open [GitHub Releases](https://github.com/Nowhitestar/Yulu/releases), choose the
currently advertised stable release or public release candidate, and download its
`yulu-macos-arm64-vX.Y.Z.dmg`. Install `Yulu.app` in `/Applications`, or in
`~/Applications` when you do not have administrator access, then launch it. The
self-contained App opens the setup flow and guides you through the macOS permissions
it needs:

| Component | Permission | Why |
|---|---|---|
| `Yulu.app` | Microphone | Capture your microphone |
| `Yulu.app` | Screen & System Audio Recording | Capture meeting playback with ScreenCaptureKit |

Automatic meeting-app detection checks the current user's running applications
and does not request Accessibility permission. If Accessibility was already
granted, window titles may improve detection, but Yulu never prompts for it from
the meeting scanner.

The App also owns its recording controls and dictation hotkeys; there is no
separate StatusAgent to install. Closing the window keeps them available, while
quitting Yulu removes them. Dictation insertion may require Accessibility approval
for the installed Yulu App even if an older StatusAgent was already approved.

Open the local workspace at
[`http://127.0.0.1:7777/agent-console`](http://127.0.0.1:7777/agent-console),
or start your first recording from Yulu's menu bar.
The DMG does not install a global `yulu` command.
No terminal or external runtime is required for the App's
recording controls; the CLI examples below are for existing repository/CLI
installations.

### Install another version

Open that version on the [Releases page](https://github.com/Nowhitestar/Yulu/releases),
download its `yulu-macos-arm64-vX.Y.Z.dmg`, and replace `Yulu.app` in
`/Applications`. Contributors can install the current checkout for development
dogfood with `make dev-install`.

### Update or uninstall

Yulu uses its signed Sparkle feed for stable updates. Manual recovery uses the
same release DMG: quit Yulu, drag its `Yulu.app` over the existing copy in
`/Applications`, then reopen it. Replacing the App preserves configuration and
recordings stored outside the bundle.

If an upgrade shows migration recovery, use the visible **Cancel Service
Migration** action to roll back the current attempt, inspect the preserved
evidence, then choose **Retry Service Migration** after correcting the blocker.
Do not edit the migration journal or application databases by hand.
If an attempt already started the new runtime, rollback keeps its new data in
`~/Library/Application Support/Yulu/application-migration/retained-runtime-data/`
instead of deleting runtime writes. The original legacy data and recording
library remain in place. This recovery directory is not an automatic sharing or
task-replay queue.

## How Yulu works

                            authenticated local Host
                         |                         |
                         v                         v
             selected Yulu audio engine    durable task + lease
             local (default) or xAI               |
                         |                         v
                         +----> transcript commit -> pinned Summary Provider
                                      |
                         optional authorized sharing

Agent Console -> selected general Agent -> that Agent's connectors
```

The split is intentional:

- **Yulu** owns native capture, permissions, local files, durable task state,
  artifact commits, recovery, and authorization boundaries.
- **The selected Yulu audio engine** owns realtime captions, final transcripts,
  and dictation. Selection is explicit and never falls back automatically.
- **The pinned Summary Provider** owns summary generation through the exact
  eligible xAI, Codex, or Claude Code connection selected when the
  task was created. Explicit connector delivery uses the independently selected
  supported connection in Settings → Sharing.
- **The selected general Agent** owns Agent Console conversation and its own
  connectors.

If the Host is unavailable when capture ends, Yulu atomically spools the
completion event and replays it after recovery without duplicating the automatic
task. See [Architecture](docs/ARCHITECTURE.md) for the full contract.

## CLI reference

These commands require an existing repository/CLI installation. Installing the
DMG alone does not add them to your shell. App users should use the native
controls or registered MCP tools; see [DMG and CLI entry points](docs/operations.md#dmg-and-cli-entry-points).

| Command | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `yulu status` | Show service, capture-socket, recording, and UI health |
| `yulu doctor [--json]` | Diagnose permissions, Host tasks, search, and Agent capabilities |
| `yulu record start "<title>"` | Start a native meeting recording |
| `yulu record stop` / `status` | Stop capture or inspect the live recording state |
| `yulu dictate start\|stop\|once\|toggle\|ask` | Dictate, translate, or send a voice question to Agent Console |
| `yulu status-agent hotkeys` | Print global dictation, translation, and voice-chat shortcuts |
| `yulu search "<query>"` | Search local transcripts and summaries |
| `yulu prompts ...` / `yulu vocab ...` | Manage reusable instructions and glossary context |
| `yulu mcp status\|install\|remove\|rotate-token\|test` | Manage authenticated local MCP registration |
| `yulu skill install --agent <name>` | Install or refresh the Yulu Agent skill |
| `yulu logs [audio_daemon\|ui\|scheduler\|detector\|calendar]` | Tail a runtime log |
| `yulu start` / `stop` / `restart` | Control installed background services |
| `yulu where` / `version` | Print installed paths or version metadata |

Run `yulu help` for the complete command list.

## Agent integration

Yulu exposes loopback-only, bearer-authenticated MCP tools and resources for
recording control, meeting metadata, durable task status, local search, prompts,
glossary, health, and artifact workflows.

For a DMG installation, use the [bundled MCP registration helper](docs/operations.md#dmg-and-cli-entry-points)
for the local Agent you choose, then add [the Yulu skill](skills/yulu/SKILL.md)
through that Agent's skill installation mechanism. This is optional for using
Yulu's own recording UI. Existing repository/CLI installations can use:

```bash
yulu skill install --agent codex
yulu skill install --agent claude-code
yulu mcp install --agent codex
yulu mcp test
```

After installation, an Agent can handle requests such as:

- “Start recording and call it Product weekly.”
- “What decisions did we make in meetings last week?”
- “Regenerate the summary for this meeting, then share it.”

Installing the skill alone does not install the native app or transcription
pipeline. Install Yulu first, then add the skill to each Agent you want to use.

## Agent Connection capability matrix

| Connection | Conversation | Summary | Authorization and readiness boundary |
|---|---|---|---|
| Codex / Claude Code | Supported when the exact production adapter proves its current runtime contract | Shown only where the runtime proves the stricter tool-free Summary contract | Codex requires native ChatGPT OAuth; Claude Code requires a native Claude subscription login. API-key or Bedrock login is reported but never accepted as Runtime-owned OAuth |
| OpenClaw 2026.5.12+ | Supported after disclosure and a bounded, tool-free `infer model run --gateway` probe | Not supported | The probe and conversation must prove the same Gateway/provider/model with no fallback |
| Hermes 0.20.0 | Unavailable until Hermes exposes a stable, tool-free capability-probe surface | Not supported | PATH, config, and OAuth status alone never count as ready |

Settings → AI Providers is the authoritative Agent Connection Center.
Opening it performs status inspection only and never probes a model or spends
model quota. A capability test requires its current Data Path Disclosure first.
Deleting a runtime-owned connection removes only Yulu's connection/readiness
history and future selection; it does not log out of or reconfigure the runtime.

## Data and privacy

- WAV recordings are stored under `~/Movies/Yulu` by default.
- Transcript and summary sidecars live beside their recording.
- Runtime databases, task state, and the local bearer token stay under
  `~/Library/Application Support/Yulu`; sockets stay under
  `~/Library/Caches/Yulu`, and logs stay under `~/Library/Logs/Yulu`.
  `~/.config/yulu` is read only as a legacy migration source.
- The Host binds to loopback and protects completion, transcription, and MCP
  requests with a per-install bearer token.
- Yulu does not store Agent connector credentials.
- Selecting xAI does not by itself authorize cloud processing. Before sending
  recording audio directly to xAI for speech-to-text, Yulu requires the current
  Cloud Transcription Consent after disclosing that audio leaves the computer and
  provider charges may apply. Settings → AI Providers keeps OAuth tokens and
  explicitly submitted API keys in macOS Keychain. Saving an API key does not select
  it; Credential Source remains a separate explicit choice. Yulu tests realtime
  transcription through a no-user-audio production WebSocket handshake, then tests
  summary and conversation separately; Hermes and OpenClaw do not receive the
  credential or run Yulu's audio pipeline. Selecting local keeps speech
  recognition local.
- External delivery requires explicit authorization; uncertain side effects are
  not blindly replayed.

See [Configuration](docs/configuration.md), [Operations](docs/operations.md),
and [Security](SECURITY.md) for exact controls and troubleshooting.

## Development

Yulu is macOS-first. Native capture and the system overlay are Swift, the local
Host and web UI are TypeScript, and Python handles capture orchestration,
scheduling, and macOS workflow glue.

```bash
python3 -m pytest -q

cd yulu/scripts/yulu_ui
npm test
npm run typecheck
npm run build
```

Install a checkout for local dogfood:

```bash
make dev-install
python3 yulu/scripts/doctor.py --json
curl -fsS http://127.0.0.1:7777/healthz
```
